# stocks-analysis

## Overview of Project
Automating stock analysis of several stocks using VBA. The script was developed through progressive refactoring and measuring performance.

## Results


## Summary
1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
	- pros: makes code faster. Preserves a clean and maintainable architecture in evolving code. Reduces bugs.
	- cons: No additional functionality. Costs development time. Quality dependent on previous developers work.

2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
	- The execution time has improved and the code is clearer and easier to adjust for future updates.
	- The refactored script does not give ability to analyze any set or the whole set of existing stocks. The functionality is the same as the original VBA script which is to analyse the performances of the set of 12 green stocks.
	- Recoding the refactored script would be needed to give our client the ability to analyze any set of stocks.
